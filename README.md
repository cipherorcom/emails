## Quick Deploy

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/email-system)

You can use the "Deploy to Cloudflare" button above to deploy this project to your Cloudflare account with one click. During deployment, you'll need to:

1. Get a [Resend API Key](https://resend.com)
2. Login to your Cloudflare account
3. Create the necessary KV namespace `email-store` and R2 bucket `email-attachments`
4. Set up environment variables:

   | Variable | Value | Description |
   |----------|-------|-------------|
   | RESEND_API_KEY | string | API Key from Resend |
   | AUTH_USER | string | Login username |
   | AUTH_PASSWORD | string | Login password |
   | AUTH_EMAIL | `admin <admin@example.com>` \| `admin@example.com` | Default sender email |
   | EMAIL_STORE | `email-store` | KV namespace binding |
   | EMAIL_ATTACHMENTS | `email-attachments` | R2 bucket binding |

## Project Setup

### 1. Configure Resend API

First, you need to create an account on [Resend](https://resend.com) and obtain an API key.

### 2. Configure Cloudflare Workers

Before deploying, make sure to modify the following in your `wrangler.toml` configuration file:

```toml
# KV namespace needs to be created in Cloudflare dashboard
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "EMAIL_STORE"
id = "your-kv-namespace-id" # Replace with your created KV namespace ID
preview_id = "your-dev-kv-id" # For local development

# R2 bucket for storing email attachments
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "EMAIL_ATTACHMENTS"
bucket_name = "email-attachments" # Replace with your created R2 bucket name
preview_bucket_name = "email-attachments-dev" # For local development

# Environment variables
[vars]
# Resend email service API Key
RESEND_API_KEY = "your-resend-api-key" # Replace with your Resend API key

# Authentication credentials
AUTH_USER = "admin"      # Login username
AUTH_PASSWORD = "admin123"  # Login password
AUTH_EMAIL = "admin@example.com"  # User email, used as default sender
```

### 3. Install Dependencies and Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Local development
npm run dev

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy
```

## Email Receiving Setup

To receive emails, you need to set up email routing in the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard
2. Navigate to "Email" > "Email Routing"
3. Set up your domain and create email routing rules
4. Create a rule that forwards emails to your Worker
